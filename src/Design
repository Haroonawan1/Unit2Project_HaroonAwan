LinearEquation Class

Instance Variables:
    private int x1 - this variable represents the x coordinate of point 1
    private int y1 - this variable represents the y coordinate of point 1
    private int x2 - this variable represents the x coordinate of point 2
    private int y2 - this variable represents the y coordinate of point 2

Constructor:
    public LinearEquation(String coordinate1, String coordinate2)
        The constructor take the two coordinate inputs and split them into 4 integer values which will
        each be assigned to the correct of the four instance variables. It will then save the string version
        of the points to instance variables for ease of use when printing information.

Methods:
    public double slope()
        This method will use the four instance variables and use them with the slope formula, the result
        will then be returned as a double

    public double yIntercept()
        This method will run slope() and then algebraically find the y intercept using one of the coordinate
        points which will then be returned as a double

    public String getEquation()
        This method will run slope() and yIntercept(), using the information gotten from those two methods it
        will create the equation in y = mx + b form

    public double distance()
        This method will use the four instance variables and will input them into the distance formula, the
        result will then be rounded and returned as a double

    public double getY(double x)
        This method will input the parameter x into the found equation of the line of the two coordinate points
        in order to allow the user to find the the corresponding y for x, it will then print the coordinate

    public String toString()
        This method will print out all the info required by calling the other method when necessary with the use of
        string concatenation, for example, distance() will be called when printing information about the distance between
        the points


EquationRunner
Step 1: The user will be welcomed
Step 2: The user will be prompted to enter 1 coordinate points in (x,y) format using the scanner class
Step 3: The user will be prompted to enter another coordinate points just like the other
Step 4: An object of the LinearEquation class will be made with the two coordinate points
Step 5: Information calculated within the LinearEquation class will be printed using it's toString method
Step 6: The user will be able to find another coordinate point on the line by entering an x coordinate
Step 7: The program will say goodbye to the user

LinearEquation Class

Instance Variables:
    private int x1 - this variable represents the x coordinate of point 1
    private int y1 - this variable represents the y coordinate of point 1
    private int x2 - this variable represents the x coordinate of point 2
    private int y2 - this variable represents the y coordinate of point 2

Constructor:
    public LinearEquation(String coordinate1, String coordinate2)
        The constructor take the two coordinate inputs and split them into 4 integer values which will
        each be assigned to the correct of the four instance variables

    public double slope()
        This method will use the four instance variables and use them with the slope formula, the result
        will then be rounded and returned as a double

    public double yIntercept()
        This method will run slope() and then algebraically find the y intercept using one of the coordinate
        points which will then be rounded and returned as the double

    public String getEquation()
        This method will run slope() and yIntercept(), using the information gotten from those two methods it
        will create the equation in y = mx + b form

    public double distance()
        This method will use the four instance variables and will input them into the distance formula, the
        result will then be rounded and returned as a double

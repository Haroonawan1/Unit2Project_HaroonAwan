LinearEquation Class

Instance Variables:
    private int x1 - this variable represents the x coordinate of point 1
    private int y1 - this variable represents the y coordinate of point 1
    private int x2 - this variable represents the x coordinate of point 2
    private int y2 - this variable represents the y coordinate of point 2

Constructor:
    public LinearEquation(String coordinate1, String coordinate2)
        The constructor take the two coordinate inputs and split them into 4 integer values which will
        each be assigned to the correct of the four instance variables.

Methods:
    public double slope()
        This method will put the four instance variables into the slope formula to get the slope, the result
        will then be returned as a double

    public double yIntercept()
        This method will run slope() and then find the y intercept using one of the coordinate
        points in an altered version of the y = mx + b formula, the result will then be returned as a double

    public String getEquation()
        This method will run slope() and yIntercept(), using the information gotten from those two methods it
        will create the equation in y = mx + b form

    public double distance()
        This method will use the four instance variables and will input them into the distance formula, the
        result will be rounded before being returned as a double

    public String getY(double x)
        This method will input the parameter x into the found equation of the line of the two coordinate points
        in order to allow the user to find the the corresponding y for x, it will then return the coordinate point
        as a string

    public String toString()
        This method will store all the info required by calling the other methods when necessary with the use of
        string concatenation, for example, distance() will be called when adding information about the distance between
        the points. This will be useful when printing the information


EquationRunner
Step 1: An object of the Scanner class will be made to get user input
Step 2: The user will be prompted to enter 1 coordinate points in (x,y) format using the scanner class after being welcomed
Step 3: The user will be prompted to enter another coordinate point just like the other
Step 4: An object of the LinearEquation class will be made with the two coordinate points
Step 5: Information calculated within the LinearEquation class will be printed using it's toString method
Step 6: The user will be prompted to enter a x value and it's corresponding y value will be printed to the user in coordinate form
Step 7: The program will say goodbye to the user
